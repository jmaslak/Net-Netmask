TODO Items

Good beginner tasks:
 * Use test2 native exception testing where we're using $sig{__WARN__} to
   catch exceptions
 * Refactor tests in netmask.t to not use dlist() helper (just use "is")
 * Refactor tests in netmask.t to always have descriptions

Advanced tasks:
 * Speed improvements for IPv6
